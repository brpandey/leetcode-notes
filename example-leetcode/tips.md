Question distribution - perhaps:

* 70% arrays
* 40% hashmap
* 40% sorting
* 40% string manipulation
* 31% greedy algorithms
* 30% search


Tips:
- think of the problem without code/before code
- what one tip helped you to solve the puzzle on your own?
- test your approach with a few small examples
- what are some edge cases or examples that break your algorithm
- can you reduce the problem into something else? e.g. a sorting problem?
- what data structures would you be using?
- does the problem description given any hints? like using unlimited coins (e.g. unbounded knapsack)
